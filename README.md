X - MASK

The project I am working on is a webpage that is inspired by a popular page called X.com (Former Twitter). 
The point of this project isn't funcionality but styling, because I am learning CSS through it.
This page contains a home page with buttons to either open a register form or a login form.
I am trying to make it as similar looking as the original one, because it makes it more challenging.
Not everything is 1:1 as the target page I've added transitons for smoothness effects and some fields in the register form.
